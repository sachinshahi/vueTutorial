Hooks
5 different hooks in directive

1) bind(el, binding, vnode)
This is fire as soon as element is bind to directive
el-> element in directive sits on
binding -> refers to argument, modifier that is set up on directive
vnode -> node in virtual dom

binding and vnode should be readonly. This is controlled by vuejs

2) inserted(el, binding, vnode)
inserted el in dom then we can  style it

3) updated(el, binding, vnode, oldVnode)

vnode and oldVnode should be treated as readonly

4) componentUpdated(el, binding, vnode, oldVnode)
called when component and children component is updated(everything is updated)

5) unbind(el, binding, vnode)
