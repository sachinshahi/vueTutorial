A global mixin is added to every instance and every component. Hence
we rarely used it.

Vue.mixin({
created() {
console.log('Global Mixin - Created Hook');
}
});

Output:-
Global Mixin - Created Hook // new Vue({) Main.js
Global Mixin - Created Hook // App.vue
Created // App.vue from fruitMixin created() {console.log('Created');}
Global Mixin - Created Hook // List.vue
Created // List.vue from fruitMix created()
Inside List created Hook // created() lifecycle hook of List.vue

Order of execution
Global Mixin
Local Mixin
LifeCycle hook of component
