Single File Template
A special kind of file which gets compiled during the build process which can shift be shift to build process
we don't have to use el and template
el and template compiled to js
any code can be represented to js
we don't have to vue compiler


2)main.js
This is the first file get executed

<!--
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

new Vue({
el: '#app',
render: h => h(App)
})
-->


we select app element using el
h(App) -> render some template in place of app id
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--
<template>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</template>

<script>
export default {
}
</script>

<style lang="scss">
</style>
-->

This template script and style get compile to javascript code and render to app el.



<!--
<script>
  export default {
  }
</script>
-->
What ever we export in default object is the Vue Instance
It is the same object we use in vue Instance.
We can use it as a component
We can set up methods, computed
This acts as a vue instance


npm run build
// it will build project and create build.js in dist folder



The ".vue" File

You can learn more about ".vue" Files in this Article from the official Docs: http://vuejs.org/guide/single-file-components.html

Learn more about the render()  method in another Article in the official Docs: http://vuejs.org/guide/render-function.html

Finally, it's important to be aware of the fact, that you can also load your App.vue File (your main Component/ Instance) via the following two Ways (Alternatives to render() ):

1) Using the ES6 Spread Operator (for that, you need to add babel-preset-stage-2 as a Dependency and to your .babelrc File):

<!--
npm install &#45;&#45;save-dev babel-preset-stage-2

.babelrc:

{
"presets": [
["es2015", { "modules": false }],
["stage-2"]
]
}
-->


<!--
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

new Vue({
el: '#app',
...App
});

-->

2) Using mount() :

Also install the stage-2 preset as described above.
<!--

import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

const vm = new Vue({
...App
});

vm.$mount('#app');

-->

Local CSS / Sass Files and CLI Templates

The webpack-simple template doesn't support local CSS or Sass files, because no CSS loader is set up.

Use the webpack template (not webpack-simple) to get this functionality: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack
